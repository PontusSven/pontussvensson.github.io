		<p>The first time I came in contact with code was when I was 18, my teacher showed me the unlimitation of what code can do. I started my education in Gothenburg at a progam called "System Development" and it is one of my best choices I've done.
			<br>
			<br>
			Today I work with coding every day. At work I always want to succeed, developing solutions to exceed the clients expectations and to develop my own knowledge. I hunger for self development, I always want to expand what I can do... wether it is a new language or a new framework.
			<br>
			<br>
			The mindset to self develop is not only imperative, its a lifestyle in which I embrace.
			<br>
			<br>
			I started out as a backend developer, focusing on Go (Golang) and C# towards AWS. As time went I took more and more responsibilities and started to develop my skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, on the road to full-stack.
			<br>
			<br>
			Outside work I am a active person either sailing on the western coast of Sweden or practising some kind of sport with my friends. Another passion of mine is cooking, which I enjoy experimenting with to explore new flavors.
